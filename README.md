## Lessons Learned:

I learned that if one commit isn't enough to realize a new feature, it's best to implement a whole branch / pull request for the new feature. This helps ensure that commit messages are meaningful as the project develops.

This was the first browser extension I developed, so it taught me a lot about how browser extensions work and how to develop them.

I had quite a bit of fun handcrafting the UI to be modern and reducing how visually busy it was. I also learned a lot about designing a snappy and modern UX. I'm passionate about crafting full-stack software that just feels good to use. This taught me a lot about what makes for good UI/UX

I've learned a lot about taking ownership of software, how even with a defined scope there are so many little features and requirements that are not evident from the outset. So taking ownership of a piece of software means using it and incorporating feedback, figuring out how to fix the things that were never considered, as well as updating your vision for the project based on feedback from using it.

## Lessons Learned:

-I learned that if one commit isn't enough to realize a new feature, it's best to implement a whole branch / pull request for the new feature. This helps ensure that commit messages are meaningful as the project develops.

-I've learned a lot about taking ownership of software, how even with a defined scope there are so many little features that are not evident from the outset. So taking ownership of a piece of software means using it and incorporating feedback, figuring out how to fix the things that were never considered, as well as updating your vision for the project based on feedback from using it.
